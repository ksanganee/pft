linear regression 
+ clear patterns in the data so would be useful
- output is complicated as is an array of numbers
- hard to train with not the most amount of data
- would involve many queries to the plaid api and may be using data which user has not given permission to use


simple prediction
+ fast
+ easy to understand


neural network
- would be hard to train
- lots of learning
- would involve many queries to the plaid api and may be using data which user has not given permission to use
