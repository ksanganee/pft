\chapter{Implementation}
\label{ch:implementation}

In this chapter, we describe the implementation of the design we described in \Cref{ch:design}. You should \textbf{not} describe every line of code in your implementation. Instead, you should focus on the interesting aspects of the implementation: that is, the most challenging parts that would not be obvious to an average Computer Scientist. Include diagrams, short code snippets, etc. for illustration.
