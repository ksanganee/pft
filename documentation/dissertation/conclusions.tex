\section{Summary}
Overall, the project was a success as the initial requirements were met as well as a success in completing the title of this dissertation. A performant web application was made with minimalism and elegance in mind. The website features live transactional information in the form of strategies which aim to help increase financial capability. Giving on overview of all areas of a user's finances will help to inform their better decisions. The ability to toggle accounts on and off is a new feature not found in current personal finance tools. The proper Plaid authentication flow was followed with clear separation between frontend and backend. An accurate, by some measure, machine learning model was built to make expenditure predictions for all users. Finally, this was all incorporated, with the database, into a single deployable web application bundle.

\section{Future Work}
Follow up work that could continue from the end of this project includes building further strategies. More strategies mean more information available for the user. There would still be an emphasis on avoiding complexity an an attempt to not confuse the user, so these would have to be carefully considered, but there is potential for more.

In addition to this, Plaid also offer sending money between bank accounts. A potential feature that could be included in the application would be the ability to make transactions between linked accounts. A user could discover that they have surplus money in their spending account, then using the tool, they could transfer this money to their savings account.

Finally, after developing a web application, the next step is to maintain it. The application will need to be kept up to date with security measures as handles sensitive data, as well as fixing any bugs that may arise. New and better libraries are often released, so there is always potential to simplify and improve the technologies used in this application.
