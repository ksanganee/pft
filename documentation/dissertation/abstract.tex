    Open banking is the recent movement where banks have created a set of endpoints allowing third parties to access their customers' data with explicit consent. For this project, an investigation is carried out on the current financial tools as well as what information best helps a user make intelligent financial decisions. Following this research, a full-stack web application is built with these findings and exploits the open banking movement to create a personal finance tool.

    The tool contains four different strategies for the user to take advantage of. These are transactions, categories, budgets and investments. For each, the report compares different ideas of how to present the information and how the final decision was designed and implemented in the application. The transactions strategy is a simple overview of their transactions; the categories strategy is a breakdown of their recent expenditure; the budgets strategy helps them set a budget and predict future expenses; and the investments strategy is a portfolio manager and tracker.

    The project evaluates the efficacy of the strategies and the web application as a whole, then concludes with potential future work and improvements.
