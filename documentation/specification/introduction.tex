\section{Problem Discussion}
Managing your personal finances has always been hard, whether you use a limited mobile app, a basic Excel spreadsheet, or you don't at all. The current cost of living crisis affecting the UK only makes matters worse, with household essentials increasing faster than incomes \cite{hourston_2022}.  

The concept of financial capability is the combination of financial knowledge, skills, attitudes, and confidence that lead to positive financial behaviours and money management decisions that fit the circumstances of an individual's life \cite{FinancialCapabilityAU}. It gives people the power to make the most of their money and improve their lives \cite{FinancialCapabilityUK}.

The aim of this project is to analyse the best strategies for individuals to better their understanding of money management and improve their financial capability; then implement these ideas into a web-based, free personal finance tool.
