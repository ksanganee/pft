\section{Background}
I will categorise the existing software into three sections, all of which have their own problems. 

Firstly, there is the mobile banking apps such as Revolut and Monzo, they track your spending within those specific accounts, but often struggle or don't at all integrate across banks to have a centralised view. Furthermore, to use these services you have to sign up with that bank; people are less likely to trust mobile apps with their personal data than websites; and to get started the app has to be installed over just accessing a site.

Then there are the websites which allow you to sync data with your bank. After signing up, you enable the website to access your bank accounts, which then very slowly imports all your data. Navigating on these are unintuitive and eventually after you find a service which doesn't cost a fortune, the obstructive adverts will pop up and block you from even using it. In addition, some sites are known to not have enough features to entice you to make it worth using and others have too many useless features which don't actually help and instead overwhelm the user.

The third category are the websites or apps which do not let you integrate your accounts. These expect you to manually add your banking information and then they perform analysis to provide suggestions on how to save. They are little better than an Excel spreadsheet and are by far the worst of the three categories.

Ideally, my software will solve the problems with the existing solutions, incorporate the best features they have into one, and have additional functionalities which I deem to be helpful in improving money management from my research.

In trying to avoid the category of software which doesn't let individuals sync across their banking information, the project will utilise the data from endpoints as a result of the open banking movement. In particular, it will use the Plaid API, enabling the solution to obtain information from all bank accounts a user gives permission to access, in one centralised location for easy analysis and better results.
